# Beginner's Analytics Handbook
Collection of resources that I found helpful

[Dylan Mervis] â€” Feb 2022

I recently had a friend ask how I got my start in teaching myself to code and the data science process. Here's a list of helpful resources in various topics that helped speed up the learning curve. Data science is one of those 'the sea gets larger the further you swim in' fields, so pick what interests you and continually branch off from there. I started learning R first simply because I couldn't figure out how to download Python on my computer (this seems to be a common theme actually). Just start learning whichever is more intuitive to you. I will say that if you are looking to switch a careers, a majority of the job descriptions I've seen ask for Python skills, but if you start with R learning Python after is not very difficult. Lastly, while reading all of the below will be very helpful, what really got me over the hump was copy/pasting scripts from very smart people, and going line-by-line to see what each line of code did. Chances are whatever you are attempting to do, someone else has already done it, so look online, find some code, and start Googling errors.

There are a few different types of resources you'll find below:
1. Textbooks on Data Science/Machine Learning (mainly in R)
2. Textbooks on Probability & Statistics
3. Research papers and various articles with code in them
4. GitHub repositories with helpful code

##### Installing R & Python
R: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
Python: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

##### Starting Points
Pick a couple of these and see what sticks. I started with R For Data Science, which will quickly get you using R, and An Introduction to Statistical Learning, which has awesome resources online and gets into theory and applications of statistical learning.
Python:
- [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/)
- [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) direct from the official source: `docs.python.org`.
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
- [Python Pandas: An Introduction For Complete Beginners](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/python-pandas-tutorial-complete-introduction-for-beginners/)

R:
- [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
- [Introduction to Data Science](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/)
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf)

Probability & Statistics:
- [Statistics 110: Probability](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube)
- [Bayesian Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjWSgPmViK-MdyGoghJ9xqOH-2yvftsjF)

##### Once Your Feet Are Off The Ground
The Python documentations and user guides for it's packages are awesome. These are taken straight from Devin Pleuler's [Soccer Analytics Handbook](https://github.com/devinpleuler/analytics-handbook)
Python:
- [`Numpy`](https://numpy.org/) - A fundamental library for scientific computing in `Python`. Particularly great for optimized vector and matrix calculations.
- [`Pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - A fast data analysis and manipulation library. It's `DataFrame` functionality is super useful (and reminiscent of some good bits of `R`)
- [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Package that hosts the majority of Python's machine learning functionalities

R:
- [Applied Predictive Modeling](https://www.academia.edu/41760919/Applied_predictive_modeling_max_kuhn_kjell_johnson) - Max Kuhn is the man. Anything by him will be worth your time
- [Machine Learning Mastery With R](file:///Users/dylanmervis/Downloads/7.%20Machine%20Learning%20Mastery%20With%20R-Get%20Started,%20Build%20Accurate%20Models%20and%20Work%20Through%20Projects%20Step-by-Step.pdf)
- [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) - Most of these listed deal with machine learning. This one is great for going deeper into R's capabilities
- [Hands On Machine Learning](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/intro.html)
- [Feature Engineering & Selection](http://www.feat.engineering/intro-intro.html) - Max Kuhn again
- [Tidy Modeling With R](https://www.tmwr.org/) - Max Kuhn again

Probability & Statistics:
- [An Introduction to Probability Theory & It's Applications](http://www.ru.ac.bd/stat/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2019/03/101_06_Feller_An-Introduction-to-Probability-Theory-and-Its-Applications-Vol.-2.pdf)
- [Statistical Inference](https://mybiostats.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/casella-berger.pdf)

##### Various Other Resources
These are other non-textbook resources that have really helped me out:
- [R to Python](https://gist.github.com/conormm/fd8b1980c28dd21cfaf6975c86c74d07) - Data wrangling with R's dplyr and Python's Pandas
- [The Mockup Blog](https://themockup.blog/) - Thomas Mock's blog detailing various R capabilites
- [Julia Silge] - Julia Silge's blog utilizing TidyModels through the entirety of the data science process
- [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/) - Very helpful in learning various analytics techniques in Python
- [Python & R For the Modern Data Scientist](http://www.ylz.ncx.mybluehost.me/moderndata.design/PyR4MDS/) Great resource comparing Python and R side-by-side
- [R Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - Cheatsheets put together by the RStudio team
- [Python Cheatsheet](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/)
